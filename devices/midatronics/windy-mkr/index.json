{"additionalradios":[],"battery":null,"codecs":{},"compliances":null,"datasheeturl":"","description":"MKR WINDY is an Arduino MKR1000 form factor board based on the Midatronics WINDY Module, an IoT module with onboard uFL connector based on the ST Microelectronics STM32WL, System-On-Chip integrates both a general-purpose microcontroller and a sub-GHz radio on the same chip. Built on an Arm® Cortex®‐M4 core architecture, STM32WL microcontrollers also support multiple modulations – LoRa®, (G)FSK, (G)MSK, BPSK – to ensure flexibility in wireless applications with LoRaWAN®, Sigfox® or any other suitable protocol in a fully open way. The windy module features a sub-GHz radio based-on Semtech SX126x to meet the requirements of a wide range of Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) wireless applications in industrial and consumer Internet-of-Things (IoT).","dimensions":null,"draft":false,"firmwareversions":[{"hardwareVersions":["1.0"],"numeric":1,"profiles":{"EU863-870":{"codec":"","id":"windy-mkr-profile","lorawanCertified":false}},"version":"1.0"}],"hardwareversions":[],"ipcode":"","iscjklanguage":false,"modelid":"windy-mkr","name":"MKR WINDY","operatingconditions":null,"outputs":[{"mediaType":"text/html","name":"HTML","path":"","baseName":"index","rel":"canonical","protocol":"","isPlainText":false,"isHTML":true,"noUgly":false,"notAlternative":false,"permalinkable":true,"weight":10},{"mediaType":"application/json","name":"JSON","path":"","baseName":"index","rel":"alternate","protocol":"","isPlainText":true,"isHTML":false,"noUgly":false,"notAlternative":false,"permalinkable":false,"weight":0}],"photos":{"main":"windy-mkr.png","other":[]},"producturl":"https://midatronics.com/shop/development-boards/mkr-windy/","resellerurls":[],"sensors":[],"tags":["","EU863-870"],"title":"MKR WINDY","vendor":{"description":"","email":"","enddevices":["windy-module","windy-mkr","sharky-module"],"id":"midatronics","name":"Midatronics","title":"","vendorid":0,"website":"https://midatronics.com/"},"video":"","videos":null,"weight":0}
